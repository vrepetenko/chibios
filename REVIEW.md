# ChibiOS Pull-Request Review Procedure

This is the review procedure for ChibiOS pull requests, carried out by the
`chibios-sheriff` assistant (first layer) and the human maintainers (final say).
It also serves as the review-guidance file for any automated reviewer.

## Role & boundaries
- The automated review is a **first layer and advisory**. It never merges; a human
  maintainer (the project lead or the relevant port owner) makes the merge decision.
- An automated approval is **advisory** and does not substitute for human review.
- **Fork PRs:** *compile* the change, but do **not run** the resulting binary on the
  host (the POSIX simulator would execute contributor code). Run only in a sandbox if
  execution is genuinely needed.

## 0. Intake
- Capture: repo, PR number, author, **base branch**, size (files, +/-), description, linked issue.
- **Targeting rule (upstream-first):** ALL changes land on `main` first. The `stable-*`
  branches only receive **backports of commits already merged on `main`**, selected by the
  maintainer (typically bugfixes/regressions). PRs targeting `stable-*` directly are
  redirected to `main`; the stable backport is decided after the `main` merge.
- Scope sanity: reasonable size, on-topic, not bundling unrelated changes.

## 1. Fetch
- `gh pr checkout <n>` into a worktree/scratch; `git submodule update --init --recursive`
  if `ext` or `tools/ftl` are touched.

## 2. Staged review (stop at the first stage with findings)
Reviews are run in **stages of increasing depth**, and each pass posts **only the
findings of the stage it stopped at**. A stage that yields no problems is passed
through silently — the pass **proceeds to the next stage** in the same session; in
the best case a single pass runs A through D and ends in an advisory-LGTM. If a
stage produces blocking or should-fix findings, **stop there**: post them, let the
author fix, then the next pass resumes from that stage and goes deeper. This avoids
overwhelming the PR with one giant wall-of-text review, and avoids spending
deep-review effort on code that is about to change anyway.

Intake (§0) findings have no stage of their own: they are reported together with the
Stage A pass.

**Re-review passes:** start from the previously posted findings — explicitly verify
each open item against the new head (resolved / still open / fix ineffective) before
looking at anything new. A fix round is judged by whether it closes the loop, not by
whether it changed code; carried findings are restated, not silently dropped.

- **Stage A — build (objective):** the POSIX simulator (host gcc) plus the most
  relevant ARM target(s) for the touched port(s). Failure → **request changes**,
  stop here.
- **Stage B — structural scan (cheap judgment):** layering, conventions, scope,
  headers/docs — the "easy" dimensions of §3. Findings → post, stop here.
- **Stage C — deep review (expensive judgment):** correctness/concurrency,
  registers vs. datasheet, portability, resource/safety — the remaining dimensions
  of §3. Only reached when A and B are clean.
- **Stage D — style (final polish):** `tools/style/stylecheck.py` on the changed
  `.c`/`.h` files, checked **last**, once the content is settled — otherwise every
  fix round would re-trigger it. On `main` PRs the CI style job re-runs on every
  push anyway, so the author sees findings continuously; the sheriff only verifies
  it is clean before an advisory-LGTM.

Nits found early may be carried along to later passes instead of forcing a stop on
their own; only blocking/should-fix findings gate a stage. State in the summary which
stage the pass reached, so the author knows a clean comment is not yet a full review.

The **first review posted on a PR** must include the **frozen disclaimer** (see the
review output template) explaining that the review is articulated in four stages —
so an early stop is not mistaken for the full review. Use it verbatim; do not
regenerate or rephrase it.

## 3. Judgment review, by dimension
Stage B dimensions (cheap, check first):
- **Architectural layering:** the change sits in the correct layer. No vendor/port-isms
  leaking upward (e.g. STM32 register names, family-specific assumptions or behavior
  exposed in the high-level HAL, RT or OSAL); portable code stays portable,
  family-specific code stays in the LLD/port layer; abstractions are not bent to fit
  one silicon family.
- **HAL/port conventions:** driver model, LLD structure, OSAL usage, naming,
  `.chcfg`/`.mk` consistency.
- **Headers/docs/tests:** license headers present/correct; doxygen comments updated;
  test suite updated or added when behavior changes.

Stage C dimensions (deep):
- **Correctness & concurrency (RTOS):** logic, races, ISR-safety, no blocking in ISR,
  critical-section/locking discipline, thread priorities.
- **Hardware/registers:** bitfields, masks, channel counts vs. the datasheet.
- **Portability:** does not break other ports/configs; `#if` conditionals correct; no
  accidental coupling.
- **API/ABI stability:** on `stable-*`, no public API breaks; backward compatibility.
- **Resource/safety:** no prohibited dynamic allocation, stack/footprint, deterministic
  timing, MISRA-oriented hygiene.

## 4. Findings & verdict
- Severity: **blocking** (correctness/safety/API break, or build/style failure),
  **should-fix** (conventions), **nit** (cosmetic).
- Verdict: **request changes** if any blocking item; **comment** if only should-fix/nit;
  **advisory-LGTM** only when stages C and D completed clean (a pass stopped at A or B
  can never be an advisory-LGTM).
- For small, clear issues, offer to draft/push a fix to the PR branch.

## 5. Post & handoff
- Post inline comments on the relevant lines plus a summary block with severity-tagged
  findings.
- **Keep it digestible:** post only the current stage's findings (see §2); prefer a
  handful of inline comments over long prose; one summary block per pass.
- **Stay scoped to the PR:** do not discuss unrelated or base-branch problems in PR
  comments — handle those through separate channels. If CI is red for a reason not
  caused by the PR, say only that it is a known project-side issue being addressed;
  no details about the unrelated problem.
- **Make findings reproducible:** when reporting style findings, include the local
  reproduction hint so the author can self-check before pushing:
  `python3 tools/style/stylecheck.py <file>` (findings are printed as `style:`/
  `error:` lines; the tool always exits 0 — read the output, not the exit code).
- Summarize to the maintainer; **the human decides the merge.**

## 6. Backports (stable-*)
Backports are **manual by design** — the stable branches have diverged from `main`
(different port layouts, no XHAL, different test trees), so cherry-picks need adaptation
and judgment; there is no automatic mechanism.
- **Selection:** the maintainer picks which merged `main` commits get backported and to
  which `stable-*` branches.
- **Execution:** cherry-pick onto the target branch, adapt to that branch's layout, then
  run the mechanical gates **locally** (stylecheck on touched `.c/.h` + a representative
  build for the touched port) — the stable branches have no CI.
- The backport commit message references the original `main` commit hash.
- **Changelog is the visible record:** the change's entry in `readme.txt` on `main` gains a
  `(backported to <release>)` annotation — one per stable release that received it, e.g.
  `(backported to 21.11.6).` An entry without annotations has not been backported anywhere.
- Landing: via PR (review rules apply) or direct maintainer push.

## Review output template
Post the review as one summary block (plus inline comments on specific lines where useful),
using this shape:

```
🤖 chibios-sheriff — first-layer review (advisory)   ← automated reviews MUST open with this AI-disclosure line

Scope: <what changed, target branch — one line>
Stage reached: A (build) | B (structural) | C (deep) | D (style)   ← per §2; below D means "not a full review yet"

<first review on the PR only — include the frozen disclaimer below, verbatim>:

> **Note:** this is a staged review — **A** build → **B** structural → **C** deep →
> **D** style. Each pass stops at the first stage with findings; after a fix, the
> next pass resumes from there and goes deeper. An early short review is therefore
> not the full review yet.

Blocking:    <correctness/safety/API-break/build or style failures — or omit if none>
Should-fix:  <convention/quality items — or omit>
Notes:       <non-blocking nits/observations — or omit>

Mechanical gates: <style + build result, or what wasn't run this pass>

Verdict: request changes | comment | advisory-LGTM  (+ any condition)
```

Human reviewers use the same structure, minus the `🤖` disclosure line (that line is required
for automated reviewers, which can't carry GitHub's native `[bot]` badge).

## Cadence
- Pull-based: a maintainer brings a PR to a review session.
